 Change is a cross-campus collaboration bringing together faculty and students from the University of Washington with the wider community to collaborate on and explore the challenges of developing technology in the context of positive social change. The change organization seeks to make connections between researchers, outside organizations, and the public to inspire the development of new capabilities aligned with the interests of those most in need.
