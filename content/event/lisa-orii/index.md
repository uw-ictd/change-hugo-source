abstract: "The development and adoption of eHealth in low- and middle-income countries has potential to advance the quality of care in healthcare settings that are challenged by weak infrastructure. Especially in the countries where HIV rates are high, there is need to implement electronic medical record systems to enhance care and improve treatment outcomes. Due to the sensitivity of HIV-related information, eHealth applications in HIV care necessitate the attention and prioritization of data security and privacy. We explored diverse stakeholders’ views on data security and privacy in Malawi’s public HIV care program to expand the understanding of gaps and opportunities in improving data protections. This work connects data security and privacy goals and practices with previous work on mobile device usage as well as global best practices for security and privacy in healthcare settings. A key finding articulated by stakeholders is the importance of establishing strong data security governance."
