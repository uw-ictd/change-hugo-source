abstract: "Implementation science (IS) is the scientific study of methods and strategies that facilitate the uptake of research and evidence-based practices into regular use by practitioners and policymakers. The field of IS is increasingly incorporating approaches from HCD/HCI to achieve its objectives, but less work has been focused on leveraging implementation science to advance HCD/HCI. This talk will review work at the intersection of implementation science and HCD/HCI, including work conducted at the UW ALACRITY Center."
