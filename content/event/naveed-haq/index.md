abstract: "In 2022, we initiated a community network project in the land of the Himalayas (Nepal) to provide Internet access to Sherpa people. This network is located in Khunde and Khumjung villages, 30 Km away from the Mount Everest base camp. This year, we upgraded the network through a fiber optic cable by providing home connectivity to these 1700 Sherpa people. In this talk, I'll be discussing our experience providing internet connectivity to Sherpa people."
