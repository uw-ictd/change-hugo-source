abstract: "In this talk, I will give an informal overview of UW CSE work in Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICTD).  The 20 year number is (almost) accurate â€“ as the first UW CSE paper in the area (by Tapan Parikh) dates from November 2003.  This talk will survey a range of projects conducted by the lab, with a focus on Interventionist ICTD, highlighting work of graduate students and postdocs.   One of the main projects that will be presented in the NSF Smart Health and Wellbeing project: From the Ground Up - Mobile Tools for Grassroots Programs in Public Health which brought together a range of projects in Data Collection,  Mobile Diagnostics,  and Behavior Change Communication and had strong external partnerships."

<b>Presenter Bio</b>
<br>
Richard Anderson is a Professor of Computer Science and Engineering, where he has been on the faculty since 1986, with brief leaves to Indian Institute of Science, Microsoft Research, and PATH. His research has focused on computing for the developing world since 2005, when he became involved with the Digital Study Hall project. In 2009, Richard spent a sabbatical year working with the Digital Health Solutions group at PATH, a global health NGO based in Seattle. This opportunity allowed him to increase his efforts on applying computing technologies to challenges in global health. While working with PATH, he co-founded the Projecting Health project, which used the Community-Led Video Education model to promote healthy practices in rural areas in India.  His research interests in ICTD include technologies for behavior change communication, improving tools to support the use of data in strengthening health systems, and digital financial services.  In 2020 he received the ACM Eugene L. Lawler Award for Humanitarian Contributions within Computer Science and Informatics for contributions bridging the fields of computer science, education, and global health.
