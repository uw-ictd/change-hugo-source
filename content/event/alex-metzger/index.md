Specifically, we'll share challenges and insights from scaling a searchable agricultural-business directory to 9833 firms in 100 villages, based on the ~1-year USSD and Android deployment in rural Tanzania, known as eKichabi v2. We'll emphasize key points regarding the utility of dual-platform technologies in the evolving mobile phone landscape, usage patterns across 1014 households, and how demographics and technology comfort influence the acceptance and impact of these technologies."
